## Promises

- ubiquitous - all of your data, merged logically into a single filesystem, yet can manifest partially in each location.
- powerful - one-click sync and backup with multiple copies.
- local - cloud services are not needed - but supported as cave locations.

## Un-goals

- file versioning - too complex to spat-chock as it defies the filesystem abstraction. Suggested workaround: store a Git
  repo or TimeMachine in hoard.
